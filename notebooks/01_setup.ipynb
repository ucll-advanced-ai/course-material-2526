    "- Keep project dependencies separate from system-wide packages\n",
    "- Avoid version conflicts between different projects\n",
    "- Make projects more reproducible for others\n",
    "\n",

    "## Step 1: Checking Python Version\n",
    "Before creating a virtual environment, check if Python is installed and which version you are using. Open a terminal and execute the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python --version\n",

    "\n",
    "Most students are probably working with Python 3.10 or higher now. Sometimes the latest Python releases aren't yet fully supported for all packages. \n",
    "We will work with PyTorch version 2.10. The working python version for this are between 3.10 and 3.13. Don't use Python 3.14 for now\n",

    "## Step 2: Creating a Virtual Environment\n",
    "You can create a virtual environment using the built-in `venv` module. These instructions assume you're working in the terminal. However, you may recall, it's also possible to create a virtual environment using the VS Code interface.\n",

    "\n",
    "This will create a folder called `venv/` that contains a clean Python installation. You can chance 'venv' in the examples above to any other name if you wish. For example, here it might make sense to name it ai-venv. You can also add a `.` in front of the name `.venv` or `.ai-venv` to create a hidden folder. Some developers prefer to keep it hidden so the project folder is cleaner.\n",

    "This part is likely new for many students. This is typically how we work with virtual environments in real life situations where multiple people are working on the same project. A requirements.txt file keeps track of the packages necessary for this project. If a project has a `requirements.txt` file listing necessary packages, you can install all of them using:\n",

    "```\n",

    "Afterwards, you can install PyTorch. Go to the [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally) and click on the correct platform (linux/windows) and your GPU/Cuda/CPU/ROC version.

    "    * run `pip install nvidia-pyindex --use-pep517 --no-cache-dir` or `pip install nvidia-cuda-runtime-cu12`: I had issues with pyindex so I tried these install options. Here cu12 is specific to my CUDA version.\n",
    "    * run `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128`: this is specific to my CUDA version, your link will depend on your SMI output\n",
